This library project will provide you with a styleable multi-state toggle button.
As opposed to the bi-state toggle button that we get in android.

The library provides listeners for observers & also has provisions for the use of custom styled vies to be used as toggle buttons.
We can provide the library with pre styled View objects to be used as toggle buttons.
